## Introduction

SocketShroud provides a suite of tools to manipulate and cloak sockets on a local area network (LAN). This toolkit is designed for white-hat hackers and penetration testers who need to create a safe environment for testing and reconnaissance. The ability to reroute traffic, create decoys, and set up honeypots makes SocketShroud an essential tool in your security arsenal.

## Features

- **Socket Cloaking**: Hide your actual socket connections to confuse potential attackers.
- **Decoy Creation**: Generate fake services that mimic real ones, drawing attention away from your actual targets.
- **Honeypot Deployment**: Set up traps to catch malicious actors and gather intelligence on their methods.
- **Traffic Manipulation**: Reroute or modify traffic in real-time for testing purposes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate, even for those new to penetration testing.

## Installation

To get started with SocketShroud, download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Ruda1106/SocketShroud/releases) section. Follow these steps to install:

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Ruda1106/SocketShroud/releases) page and download the appropriate file for your system.
2. **Execute the File**: Run the downloaded file in your terminal. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the file.

```bash
chmod +x SocketShroud
./SocketShroud
```

3. **Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. Check the documentation for a list of necessary packages.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using SocketShroud. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

### Starting a Honeypot

To start a honeypot, use the following command:

```bash
./SocketShroud honeypot --port 8080
```

This command will initiate a honeypot on port 8080. You can change the port number as needed.

### Creating a Decoy

To create a decoy service, use:

```bash
./SocketShroud decoy --service http --port 80
```

This will create a fake HTTP service on port 80.

### Rerouting Traffic

To reroute traffic from one socket to another, use:

```bash
./SocketShroud reroute --source <source_socket> --destination <destination_socket>
```

Replace `<source_socket>` and `<destination_socket>` with the actual socket addresses.

## Topics

SocketShroud covers a range of topics relevant to network security and penetration testing:

- **Debian**: Optimized for Debian-based systems.
- **Decoy**: Techniques for creating decoy services.
